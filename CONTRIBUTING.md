## Setup

The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/Jepria/jfront-oauth))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
# in a terminal, cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, then
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jfront-oauth.git

cd jfront-oauth
```

3. Setup all dependencies and build. JFront OAuth uses `yarn` and `lerna`, so
   run `yarn bootstrap`. This command will install dependencies, bootstrap the
   repo using `lerna` and build all packages.

## Development

To improve our development process, we've setup a couple of systems. JFront UI
uses a monorepo structure, this means each component is it's own package and can
use consumed independently.

### Tooling

- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage installation of dependencies and
  running various scripts. We also have yarn workspaces enabled by default.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and
  testing
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing components and
  hooks

### Commands

**`yarn boot`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.

**`yarn bootstrap`**: bootstraps the entire project and symlinks all
dependencies for cross-component development

**`yarn storybook`**: starts storybook server and loads stories in files that
ends with `.stories.tsx`

**`yarn build`**: run build for all component packages

**`yarn test`**: run test for all component packages

**`yarn version:release`**: update version for changed packages

**`yarn publish:release`**: publish changed packages

**`yarn [package] <cmd>`**: Run a command on the specific package you're working
on. You can run `build`, `test`, `lint` commands

#### Package Aliasing and Yarn Workspace

Since we're using lerna monorepo + yarn workspaces by default, this enables us
to run commands within module package directly from the root.

Each module is named this way `@jfront/oauth-[module]`. Let's say we want to
build the welcome component. Here's how to do it:

```bash
yarn workspace @jfront/oauth-welcome build

# or

lerna run build --scope @jfront/oauth-welcome
```

**Shortcut:** To make this shorter and more convenient, we've added an alias for
each component in the root `package.json`. Now you can simple do:

```bash
# to build
yarn core build

# to test
yarn core test
yarn core test --watch

# to lint
yarn core lint
```

This alias is particularly useful when you're working on a specific component
and want to avoid running the command for all components.

### Documentation

The documentation site is built with Gatsby. If you'd like to contribute to the
docs, simply run `yarn docs:start`.

### Storybook

Build components in isolation with Storybook using `yarn storybook`. Current
storybook can be found at https://jepria.github.io/jfront-oauth/.

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox
link.

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or doesn't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will addtionally reference an issue
  if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

- Fork of the jfront-oauth repository and clone your fork
- Create a new branch out of the `develop` branch. We follow the convention
  `[dev_type_scope]`. For example `dev_fix_hook`, `dev_docs_menu_typo`

  - `type` can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other
    conventional commit type
  - `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

### Continuous integration

JFront OAuth uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI
processing.

| branch              | version                     | tag      |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :------- |
| `master`            | Ð¸Ð· `package.json`           | `latest` |
| `release/<version>` | `<version>-rc.<sha>`        | `next`   |
| `develop`           | `<version>-alpha/beta<sha>` | `canary` |

- With PUSH in master branch CI updates version, creates release and publish to
  NPM.
- On release/_ branch creation version updates to _-rc.\*, publish is manual.
- PUSH/PULL_REQUEST in develop runs auto-testing, PR is not allowed if tests are
  not completed.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

> **Dear JFront team:** Please do not merge code without tests
